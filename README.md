# OptCtl for Selfish Dection in OppNet
Optimal Control for Selfish OppNets

The Ordinary Differential Equations are adopted to describe the dynamics of the nodes in different states (i.e., without message, withe message and being selfish).
The payoff is formulated as the integral form.
The Optimal Control methodology (including the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and the Shooting Method) is exploited to obtain the optimal control strategy
for the selfish node detection in the 2-hop OppNet.
