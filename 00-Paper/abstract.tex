Selfish node detection offers an effective means
to mitigate the routing performance degradation
caused by selfish behaviors in Opportunistic Networks (OppNets),
but leads to the extra network overload and computation cost.
Most existing effort in the literature focuses on
exploring the detection methods
based on the traffic analysis or the cooperation among nodes.
In this paper, we investigate the state transition of nodes
in the message dissemination without detection.
Specifically, the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is constructed
to approximatively model the periodic detection
with complete detection requirements.
Then we obtain the optimal solution of the selfish node detection
by the Pontryagin's maximum principle,
and mathematically deduce the right detection time
during the message lifetime.
The model soundness is verified statistically
and the analysis accuracy is evaluated via extensive simulations.
The experiments also show that our solution can
achieve the tradeoff between the reward and the detection cost.
