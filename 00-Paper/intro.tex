\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The main contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item {we formulate the ordinary differential equation model (ODE)
to capture and analytically evaluate the change of network state
in OppNets without detection and with fully detection.}
%\item {we propose a ODE model with continuous strategy
%to model the periodic detection in the case of fully detection.}
\item {we propose an optimal solution of selfish node detection
based on the Pontryagin's maximum principle
to achieve the balance between the detection cost 
and the wasted reward of selfish behaviors.
}
\item {we conduct experiments to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the proposed model
and the optimal selfish detection solution in terms of the total cost,
the wasted reward and the change of network state.
}
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
The literature is reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:related}.
We formulate the problem in Section~\ref{sec:preli}.
The change of network state without detection and with fully detection
is investigated in Section~\ref{sec:ode_model}.
The optimal solution of the selfish detection in OppNets
is presented in Section~\ref{sec:opt_detect},
and evaluated in Section~\ref{sec:pe}.
The paper concludes in Section~\ref{sec:conclude}.
