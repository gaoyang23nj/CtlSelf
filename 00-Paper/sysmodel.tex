% motivation
The source node $src$ needs to 
disseminate its message, 
e.g., the advertisements,
to the vehicles or pedestrians.
The $N$ relay nodes in the network can store the message of $src$
and send it to the vehicles,
which can broaden the coverage area of message.
To encourage the collaboration of relay nodes,
$src$ will reward the relay node based on the message carrying time.
However, the relay node may discard the message and
earn the reward of $src$, which is the cost of selfish behaviors.
Furthermore, $src$ can exploit the detection method to save its rewards,
i.e., query the checksum of specific part of message
to the relay node. 
In this paper, we propose the optimal detection strategy for $src$
to achieve the tradeoff between 
the cost of the sample detection and the selfish behaviors.
which is shown in Fig.~1.

$I(t)$ denotes the expected number of infected relay nodes,
which carry the message,
at time $t$.
$M(t)$ denotes the expected number of malicious relay nodes,
which have discarded the message but are not known by $src$,
at time $t$.
$S(t)$ denotes the expected number of susceptible relay nodes,
which do not carry the message and are known by $src$,
at time $t$.
Fig.2 shows the transition of state.
The message has a time-to-live, $T$.
Thus the purpose of this paper is to minimize the wasted reward,
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\begin{aligned}
J &= \int_{0}^{T} M(t) dt,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
