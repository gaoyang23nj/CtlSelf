\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:pe}
We consider a $5000 \times 5000 m^2$ sparse sensing field with
$100$ relay nodes.
The Poisson-contact
mobility model is quasi-synthetic,
in which the parameter $\lambda$ is set to $0.004$.
The source node is fixed at the center of the network scenario. 
The speed of nodes is randomly selected in a uniform distribution 
changing from 4 to 10 m/s,
and the communication range of these nodes is set to be $20$$m$.
The parameter $\alpha$ is limited, 
i.e.,
$\alpha \in [0, 1]$.
We consider two cases in the simulations.
In the first case (Section~\ref{subsec:wo_detc}),
we set $U(t)=0$,
which means there is no selfish detection. 
In the second case (Section~\ref{subsec:full_detc}),
we adopt the selfish detection method and keep detecting during whole lifetime of network.
In each simulation,
$M$ messages are created,
whose maximal lifetime $T_m$ increases from $0$$s$ to $2000$$s$.
Note that,
all statistical results of our scheme are obtained by
repeating 50 times.

As shown in Sections~\ref{sec:ode_model} and~\ref{sec:opt_detect},
we mathematically model the state transition of nodes by the ODEs,
based on which we analyze the optimal control through the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle.
It is critical to verity the accurate of the proposed model.
Therefore, 
in the first experiment,
we compare the the simulation and the analytical results to check the accuracy of models.
Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_wod} shows the comparison between the simulation and the analytical result in Case $1$, 
in which $D(t)$, $I(t)$ and $R(t)$ represent the mean values
of simulations result, 
respectively.
The dotted lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_wod} represent the analytical results.
According to Equation~(\ref{eq:IDR_wo_solu}),
we can know that the analytical results about total number of $R(t)$ is in a monotone decreasing 
situation with the growing $T$.
The magenta line in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_wod} proves this conclusion.
This is because the selfishness of node  
the change of the states
in the experiments conforms to the solved solutions (\ref{eq:IDR_wo_solu}),
As can be seen, 
the analytical results match
the simulation results reasonably, which validates the proposed
analytical model.
