\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:pe}
%We consider a $5000 \times 5000 m^2$
%sparse sensing field with
%$100$ relay nodes.
The total number of relay nodes is $100$,
excluding $src$,
which means that $N=100$.
The Poisson-contact mobility model is synthetic,
%quasi-synthetic,
%in which
where the parameter $\lambda$ is set to
$4 \times 10^{-3}$ $s^{-1}$.
The source node is fixed at the center of the network scenario.
%The speed of nodes is randomly selected in a uniform distribution
%changing from 4 to 10 m/s,
%and the communication range of these nodes is set to be $20$$m$.
We set the parameter $\rho$ as $1.1 \times 10^{-2}$ $s^{-1}$.
The weight $\alpha$ is limited,
i.e., $\alpha \in (0, 1)$.
The minimum detection cycle is that $T_{m}=1$ $s$.
Note that all statistical results in the experiments
are obtained by repeating $20$ times.
%We consider two cases in the simulations.
%In the first case (Section~\ref{subsec:wo_detc}),
%we set $U(t)=0$,
%which means there is no selfish detection.
%In the second case (Section~\ref{subsec:full_detc}),
%we adopt the selfish detection method and
%keep detecting during whole lifetime of network.
%In each simulation,
%$M$ messages are created,
%whose maximal lifetime $T$ increases from $0$$s$ to $2000$$s$.

\subsection{Accuracy of Modeling}
\label{subsec:pe_valid}

  \caption{Comparison of the theoretical an simulation results

  \label{fig:twohop_predict_full_d}
\end{figure}
As shown in Section~\ref{sec:ode_model},
we mathematically model the state transition of nodes by the ODEs,
based on which we achieve the optimal control
through the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle.
Thus it is critical to verify
%the accuracy of the proposed model.
whether the proposed model can depict the state transition
in the message lifetime,
i.e., the expected number of nodes in state $R$, $I$ and $D$.
%Therefore,
%in the first experiment,
%we compare the the simulation and
%the analytical results to check the accuracy of models.

Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_wod} shows
the comparison between the simulation
and the analytical result in Case $1$,
where the detection are not conducted at all.
Here the expected number of nodes in different states,
i.e., $D(t)$, $I(t)$ and $R(t)$
are counted as the mean value of $20$ simulations at $t$,
which is the simulation result.
%when $\lambda = 0.004$, $\rho = 0.01$, $N=100$ and $T=2,500$,
The dotted lines represent the analytical results,
which is calculated from (\ref{eq:IDR_wo_solu})
for any specific time.
We can find that the analytical $I(t)$ and $D(t)$
can match the simulated $R(t)$ and $I(t)$ closely,
%the analytical result
%match the simulation result,
which validates the accuracy of
modeling message dissemination without detection.
We notice that $I(t)$ and $D(t)$ approaches to
$\frac{ \lambda N }{ \lambda + \rho } \approx 26.7$
and $\frac{ \rho N }{ \lambda + \rho } \approx 73.3$
after $1,000$ $s$ respectively,
which is conforms to the theoretical analysis.

The experiment of case $2$, i.e., with complete detection
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_full_d}.
%The result in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_full_d} shows that
%the accuracy of the proposed ODE models in Case $2$.
We can also find that $R(t)$, $I(t)$ and $D(t)$
of the mathematical analysis in (\ref{eq:IDR_full_solu})
match that of the simulations closely,
which reveals that our proposed approximately model can
represents the decrement of nodes in state $D$ caused by detections.
Since the change of $I(t)$ relies on
the derivative of $I(t)$,
$\frac{\mathrm{d} I(t)}{\mathrm{d} t}
=  \lambda (N-I(t)) - \rho I(t)$,
$I(t)$ is not effected by the detections according to the analysis.
Thus we also find that
$I(t)$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_full_d}
is almost equal to $I(t)$
in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_wod}.
But $D(t)$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_full_d}
decreases much compared to $D(t)$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_wod} due to
the successive selfish node detections.
Similarly,
$I(t)$ and $D(t)$ approaches to
$\frac{ \lambda N }{ \lambda + \rho } \approx 26.7$
and $\frac{ \rho \lambda N }
{ (\lambda + \rho)(\lambda + \frac{U_{m}}{N}) } \approx 20.9$
when $t \rightarrow +\infty$
in the steady state.
Meanwhile, the analytical $I(t)$ and $D(t)$ also tend to be stable
as discussed in Lemma.~\ref{lem:Dstable}.
%In this figure,
%$I(t)$, $D(t)$ and $R(t)$ with time $t$
%are computed from prediction and simulations
%when $\lambda = 0.004$, $\rho = 0.011$,
%$N=100$, $T_{m} = 1$ and $T=2,500$.
%According to Equation~(\ref{eq:IDR_full_solu}),
%we can know that the analytical results about total number of $D(t)$ is in a monotone increasing
%situation when the growing $T$.
%The blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_full_d}
%proves this conclusion.
%However, the number of selfish number
%reduce to $20$ when comparing with Fig.~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_wod}.
%This is because adopting detection methods
%will mitigate the selfish behaviour of nodes.
%Fig~\ref{fig:twohop_predict_full_d} verifies
%the accuracy of the proposed ODE model again.

\subsection{Optimal Selfish Node Detection}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  {\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{fig/state.eps}}
     \caption{State variable of analysis with time.}
     \label{fig:pe_opt_state_time}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  {\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{fig/Ut.eps}}
     \caption{The optimal control policy of $U(t)$.}
     \label{fig:pe_opt_control_Ut}
\end{figure}
The weight $\alpha$ and the message lifetime $T$
are set as $0.9$ and $500$ $s$, respectively.
Then the corresponding numerical solution
of the boundary value problem (\ref{eq:bvp}),
i.e., $D(t)$ and $\lambda_{D}(t)$,
is solved and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pe_opt_state_time},
which is the state function
in the optimal solution to minimize the cost $J$.
Here $\lambda_{D}(t)$ is the co-state function,
which is introduced to obtain this optimal solution.
Since the close-form solution of $I(t)$
is not effected by the detections,
which is similar to Section.~\ref{subsec:pe_valid},
we can get $R(t)$ according to $N=R(t)+I(t)+D(t)$.

Since $D(t)$ and $\lambda_{D}(t)$ in the optimal solution
have been calculated,
$U^{*}(t)$ can be obtained based on (\ref{eq:opt_U}).
Fig.~\ref{fig:pe_opt_control_Ut} shows the optimal policy
of the selfish node detections,
when $\alpha = 0.9$ and $T=500$ $s$.
As discussed in Lemma.~\ref{lem:Ut0},
the detection always is off at the start
and the end of the message lifetime.
We can find that the optimal control
is `off-on-off' function.
In the `on' state of $U^{*}(t)$,
$src$ will conduct the self node detection
with the minimum cycle $T_{m}$.
But no detection will be conducted
in the `off' state of $U^{*}(t)$.
Thus the switching time $t_{on}$ and $t_{off}$,
around $102$ $s$ and $452$ $s$,
dominate the cost $J$ in the whole simulation.
Combining with Fig.~\ref{fig:pe_opt_state_time},
we can also find that $D(t)$ and $\lambda_{D}(t)$
is not also smooth at the switching time.
Besides the optimal policy when $\alpha=0.9$,
Fig.~\ref{lem:Ut0} also shows the optimal policy
when $\alpha=0.995$.
Since $0.995$ is higher than $\alpha_{th} =
\frac{\rho}{\lambda(\lambda+\rho)+\rho} \approx 0.9946$.
we can drive that $U^{*}(t) = 0$, $\forall t$,
which is correspond to Lemma.~\ref{lem:alpha}.
%In the second experiment,
%we analysis efficacy of the approximate method.
%Fig.~\ref{fig:pe_opt_state_time} shows
%the state transition of nodes
%with the message¡¯s maximal lifetime $T$,
%in which $M(t)$ represent ,
%$I(t)$ represent ?,
%$S(t)$ represent ? and $\lambda_2$ represent ?.
%As we can see,
%the value of $M(t)$ and the value of $\lambda_2$ decrease
%with $T$.
%In contrast,
%both $S(t)$ and $I(t)$ have growing trend with increasing $T$.
%This verify the sate transition is balanced.
%
%Fig.~\ref{fig:pe_opt_control_Ut} shows the control variable $U(t)$ with increasing time.
%From this figure,
%we can easily obtain the optimal control policy to
%minimize the $J$.
%For example,
%when $T$ equals to $100$,
%the complete detection is on an `on state'.
%When time equals to $450$,
%the network will switch from the `on state' to an `off state'.

     \label{fig:reward_ton_toff}
\end{figure}
%min_cost:1.0995e+03 max_cost:1.7286e+03
Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_ton_toff} shows the total cost $J$
with different switching time $t_{on}$ and $t_{off}$,
when $\alpha=0.9$ and $T=500$ $s$.
Here the combination $(t_{on}, t_{off})$
is greedily set from $(0, 0)$ to $(500, 500)$
with the stepwise of $20$.
Here $(t_{on}, t_{off}) = (0, 500)$
indicates the case with the complete detection.
And the situation of $t_{on} = t_{off}$
represents the case without detection.
For each specific combination $(t_{on}, t_{off})$,
the cost $J$ is approximately calculate
with $J \approx \sum_{t} (1-\alpha)D(t) + \alpha U(t)$
in out experiments.
Additionally, the time granularity of $0.1$ $s$
during $20$ times simulations.
We can find that $J$ ranges around from $1,100$ to $1,700$.
The optimal solution according to our method is that
$t_{on}=102.1$ $s$ and $t_{off}=402.59$ $s$,
whose cost $J$ is $1109.87$
indicated by `*'.
Thus the proposed method in this paper
can provide the near optimal solution of the selfish node detection,
i.e., around the minimum cost $J_{min}$,
in the opportunistic network.
%Lemma.~\ref{lem:Ut0} introduce that the parameter $t_0$ and $t_1$ ?.
%Therefore,
%in the third experiment,
%we analysis the impact of different $t_0$ and $t_1$.
%As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pe_diff_choices},
%the total cost is calculated by adjusting $t_0$ and $t_1$
%form $0$ to $400$ and from $0$ to $500$,
%respectively.
%We can observe that the total cost of system has a minimal value.
%For example,
%when $t_0=80$ and $t_1=430$,
%the cost is $?$.
%It is clear that the optimal cost can guide the design of OppNets,
%where the selfish nodes exist.

%min_reward:1.8904e+03 max_reward:2.9107e+03
The total reward $P$ with ($t_{on}, t_{off}$) is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:reward_ton_toff},
where the unit reward $\beta$ in (\ref{eq:reward}) is set as $0.9$.
We can find that the minimum reward, i.e., around $1,900$
at ($t_{on}, t_{off}$) is ($0$,$500$),
which is because all the possible detections are conducted.
When $t_{on} = t_{off}$,
the case without detection leads to the maximum reward from $src$ to
the relay nodes.
The difference between the cost $J$ and the reward $P$
is that we introduce the detection cost
$\int_{0}^{T} U(t) \mathrm{d}t$.
Meanwhile, the utilization ratio of reward
according the optimal solution
is about $41$ \%.

%\subsection{Cost $J$ v.s. weight $\alpha$}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  {\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{fig/cost_vs_alpha.eps}}
     \caption{Total cost $J$ v.s. $\alpha$.}
     \label{fig:cost_alpha}
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_alpha} shows the total cost $J$ of different methods
when $\alpha$ ranges from $0.7$ to $1$.
We can find that our method always can
provide the solution with the minimum cost
when $0.7 \le \alpha \le 1$.
Note that there are some deviations of cost
since the experiments are conducted
with the random settings of the contacts and
the detected nodes.
The method with complete detection performs better
than the method without detection in terms of the cost $J$
when $0.7 \le \alpha<0.94$.
But the method without detection is better
when $0.94 < \alpha \le 1$.
This is because that the high $\alpha$ indicates that
the increment of the cost $J$
is affected more by the detections than by the selfish behaviors.
Here the performance comparison in the situations,
when $0 \le \alpha < 0.7$,
is omitted,
because the cost of our method and the method with complete detection
are still lower than that of others.
Meanwhile, the cost of the method with half detection,
where the detection rate is $\frac{U_{m}}{2}$ in the message lifetime ,
locates between the the method with complete detection
and the method without detection.
